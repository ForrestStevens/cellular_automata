All code in this repository is provided for your use and pleasure as
you see fit.  It was meant to be used as a starting point for an exploration
of cellular automata models in the R statistical computing environment.

It was inspired by two blog posts:
	http://aschinchon.wordpress.com/2014/09/04/looking-for-life/
	http://aschinchon.wordpress.com/2014/01/14/cellular-automata-the-beauty-of-simplicity/

Some of the code was re-used but much of it was refactored to be much
more efficient for processing in a modern R environment.
